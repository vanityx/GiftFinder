# GiftFinder

"GiftFinder" is one of my first programming projects. It is a website that was made using the Python Flask framework, Javascript, HTML and CSS. 
It is, as the name suggests, a gift finder, which filters through an SQL database of products, to find relevant gifts based off of a short questionnaire.
